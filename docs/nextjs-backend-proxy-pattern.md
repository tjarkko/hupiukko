# Next.js API Proxy Pattern for Secure Backend Access

## What is it?
- The Next.js API proxy pattern uses API routes (e.g., `/api/proxy/*`) to securely forward requests from the frontend to a backend API.
- The proxy route runs server-side, attaches the user's bearer token (from next-auth), and returns the backend's response to the frontend.

## Why use this pattern?
- **Security:**
  - The browser never sees the backend API URL or the user's access token.
  - Only the Next.js server can call the backend with the user's credentials.
- **Keeps backend private:**
  - The backend API does not need to be exposed to the public internet.
- **Centralized logic:**
  - You can add logging, error handling, or transform requests/responses in one place.
- **Works with SSR, SSG, and client-side data fetching.**
- **Recommended by Next.js and Vercel for secure API access.**

## How does it work?
1. The frontend calls a Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/proxy/Exercises/categories`).
2. The API route runs server-side, gets the user's session and access token, and forwards the request to the backend API.
3. The backend API sees a valid bearer token and returns data.
4. The API route returns the backend's response to the frontend.

## Alternatives
- **Direct API calls from the browser:**
  - Exposes backend API and tokens to the public; less secure.
- **Separate BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) server:**
  - More complex, but similar in spirit.
- **GraphQL Gateway:**
  - For microservices or GraphQL-first architectures.
- **SSR-only:**
  - Only fetch data server-side, never expose an API to the client (less flexible for interactivity).

## When to use this pattern?
- You want to keep your backend API private.
- You need to attach user credentials (bearer token) to backend requests.
- You want a secure, flexible, and modern full-stack architecture.

---

**In summary:**
- The Next.js API proxy pattern is a secure, modern, and widely used solution for full-stack apps that need to call protected backend APIs from the frontend.
- It is recommended for most Next.js + API scenarios where security and flexibility are important.
